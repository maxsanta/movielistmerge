# movielistmerge

Export a films list that has both ad Imdb version and an iCheckmovies version.
This script will merge both with the most important data from each list.
For instance, iCM csv exports lack a runtime, but imdb don't, while, Imdb doesnt have offical status that iCM list do have.
The resulting list will have all the data you need in a handy format.
